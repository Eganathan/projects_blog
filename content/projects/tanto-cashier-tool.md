# Tanto-Cashier-Tool

This is a basic simple Python application that was developed by me for solving a problem that I was facing while working at a restaurant at Auroville. The restaurant had different discounts for different type of people like residents have -20%, Volunteers have -10% and outsiders have +5% Tax. I built this application to solve a real world problem.

## The Problem

Working at a restaurant in Auroville, I encountered a daily challenge with the cashier system. The restaurant had a complex pricing structure with different rates for different groups:

- **Residents**: 20% discount
- **Volunteers**: 10% discount  
- **Outsiders**: 5% tax added

Manual calculations were time-consuming and error-prone, especially during busy periods. This created bottlenecks and frustrated both staff and customers.

## The Solution

I developed this Python application using TkInter for the GUI to automate the cashier calculations. This shows my solution-oriented mentality in solving real-life problems with technology.

## Key Features

- **Simple GUI**: Built with Python's TkInter module for easy use by restaurant staff
- **Automated Calculations**: Eliminates manual calculation errors
- **Multiple Customer Types**: Supports residents, volunteers, and outsiders with their respective pricing
- **Real-World Tested**: Actually used in a working restaurant environment

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3**: Core programming language
- **TkInter**: GUI framework for the user interface
- **Desktop Application**: Standalone tool that runs locally

## Impact

This tool streamlined the cashier process at the restaurant, reducing calculation time and eliminating pricing errors. It demonstrated how simple technology solutions can solve immediate real-world problems effectively.

This project represents my early approach to identifying pain points in daily operations and creating practical software solutions to address them - a philosophy I continue to apply in my development work today.
