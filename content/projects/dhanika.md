# Dhanika: A Vibe-Coded Budget Tracker

This project, **Dhanika**, is the result of a personal experiment in "vibe coding." It started as a simple tool to solve a real-life problem of mine: to truly understand where my money was going. While spreadsheets are powerful, I wanted something more intuitive, more visual, and something that respected my privacy completely.

This is more than just a budget app; it's a testament to a development philosophy centered on intuition, user experience, and solving tangible problems with the tools at hand.

## Core Philosophy & Vibe

-   **Privacy by Design**: In a world of data harvesting, Dhanika takes a firm stance. All your financial data lives and dies in your browser's local storage. There is no server, no database, no tracking. It's your data, period.
-   **Vibe-Driven Development**: This wasn't a project built on rigid sprints and a huge backlog. It was "vibe coded"â€”organically grown feature by feature, based on what felt right and what was needed next. The goal was to create something that felt good to use.
-   **Solving My Own Problem**: The best projects often come from a personal need. I was the first user, and this tool was built to satisfy my own requirements for a simple, beautiful, and effective budget tracker.

## Key Features

-   **Zero-Knowledge**: All data is stored locally. We know nothing about your finances.
-   **Interactive & Modern UI**: A clean, responsive interface built with Bootstrap and custom CSS for a "glassmorphism" feel.
-   **Visual Insights**: Interactive doughnut and pie charts powered by Chart.js to visualize your income, expenses, and category breakdowns.
-   **Data Portability**: Securely export and import your data with AES-GCM encryption, ensuring you always have control.
-   **Multi-Currency Support**: Track your budget in over 10 currencies.

## The Tech Stack: Keepin' it Vanilla

The beauty of this project lies in its simplicity and power, achieved without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

-   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: The entire application logic is built with modern, clean JavaScript. No React, no Vue, no Angular. This keeps it lightweight and fast.
-   **HTML5 & CSS3**: Structured with semantic HTML and styled with modern CSS, including Flexbox and Grid.
-   **Bootstrap 5**: Used for the responsive grid system and core components, providing a solid foundation.
-   **Chart.js**: For beautiful, responsive, and interactive data visualizations.
-   **Web APIs**: Leverages the power of the browser with the **LocalStorage API** for data persistence and the **Web Crypto API** for secure, client-side encryption.

This project is an ongoing experiment in creating useful, beautiful, and private software. It's a demonstration of how far you can go with just the core technologies of the web, a clear vision, and a bit of vibe.
